Guten Tag, and thank you for stopping by!

I began my programming journey over a decade ago during my junior year of high school when I took a web essentials class. I excelled in this field, but life had other plans and university wasn't on the table for me. I went to basic training for the US Navy in 2011, and spent 8 years traveling the world, learning about many different technologies ranging from RADAR, cellular, satellite, and computers. Afterwards, I finished my Bachelor's of Electrical Engineering Technology. My favorite classes were my programming courses, so I decided to use my hardware engineering experience in conjunction with my software experience and begin working as a systems engineer. I am currently working on a masters degree in software engineering at Texas A&M. When I am not working with electronics or code, I spend my time playing guitar and singing, fly fishing, and spending time in my tiny home with my wife and hairless cats.
